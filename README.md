Code to render animations for videos I create.
Big thank you to 3blue1brown and the Manim community.

Some of the custom features used in my animations can
be found in the [hackermanim](https://github.com/lavafroth/hackermanim) package.

To render these, make sure to have manim and hackermanim installed.

```
pip install -U manim
pip install -U git+https://github.com/lavafroth/hackermanim
```

If you're using Nix or NixOS, make sure to install direnv to have a per-directory
isolated python setup. In the repository root allow direnv to execute like the
following:

```
direnv allow
```
